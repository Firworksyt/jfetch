# JfetchðŸŒ ðŸŽ€

A Jelly Hoshiumi themed neofetch parody written in C just for lulz.

Displays information about your operating system (Linux-only), software and hardware, and a cool jorb ascii animation.

# Usage

To build the executable you can use the build.sh script or simply compile jfetch.c with the compiler of your choice.

Jfetch has no configuration files, so if you want to remove/rearrange the outputs you will need to edit the prints_stats functions and recompile the program.

# Extras

The animation is generated by a python script (./animation/converter.py) from a jorb.gif and embedded into the C code.
In order to tinker with it you will need to install numpy and opencv as dependencies.
